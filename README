Virtualbox Web Frontend
-----------------------

This project provides a simple virtualbox frontend in php.

The goal is to be able to control virtual machines for doing
some quick deployments.

The idea is to have a set of machine templates that can be
quickly deployed using differential disk images. It takes
only a few seconds to setup a new machine and have it running.
